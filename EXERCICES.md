# ThreatScope — Candidate Exercises

Welcome 👋 and thank you for taking the time to participate in this product content exercise.

This repository contains a small demo application (ThreatScope) and a set of short tasks designed to assess product content skills such as clarity, tone alignment, user guidance, and documentation.

The exercises are time-boxed: they are intentionally short to focus on how you think, not on producing polished, final content.


## 📝 Exercise 1 — Microcopy Makeover

**Duration: _~10 minutes_**

**Context**

ThreatScope is a demo tool that lets users select their industry and operating countries, then view relevant cyber threats (actors, malware, risk levels). The homepage of the prototype currently includes microcopy that is inconsistent, verbose, or not aligned with the brand tone.

For this exercice, use the online version of this application available at: [https://threatscope-i0tj.onrender.com/](https://threatscope-i0tj.onrender.com/)

**Task**

- Review all text on the homepage
  - Section headings  
  - Helper text
  - Button labels
  - Empty state message
  - Threat card descriptions
  - Filter labels
  - Disclaimer / CTA section
- Suggest improvements that
  - Make the copy clearer and more user-friendly
  - Ensure tone consistency (professional, approachable, security-focused)
  - Improve actionability (e.g., button copy that motivates next steps)
  - Remove redundancy and jargon
- Provide your suggestions as a simple list (original → improved). For each change, include 1–2 sentences explaining why you made it.

**Deliverable**

A short document (bullets or table) showing your revised copy and reasoning.


## 📖 Exercise 2 — Getting Started Guide (Documentation PR)

**Duration: _~15 minutes_**

**Context**

The ThreatScope app includes a Documentation section, which is currently empty. The documentation is stored in this GitHub repository under the docs/ folder.

**Task**
- Create an introductory documentation page (docs/index.md) that:
  - Explains in 2–3 short paragraphs what ThreatScope is and the value it provides.
  - Includes a “How it works” section describing the 3 basic steps:
    1. Select industry
    2. Select countries
    3. View relevant threats
  - Ends with a light call-to-action encouraging users to explore (e.g., “Try it now”).
- Commit your changes on a new branch (e.g., add-intro-doc).
- Open a pull request against the main branch with:
  - A clear commit message
  - A short PR description summarizing what you wrote and why

**Deliverable**

A GitHub pull request with your draft documentation page.


## 🧩 Exercise 3 — API Documentation & OpenAPI Spec

**Duration: _~20 minutes_**

**Context**

ThreatScope exposes a small API, but its documentation is incomplete. FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI schema at /docs and /openapi.json, but without descriptive metadata it is not very useful.
The API exposes:
* GET /api/countries → list countries
* GET /api/industries → list industries
* GET /api/threats → list threats
* GET /api/threats/{threat_id} → threat by id (404 if missing)
* POST /api/threats/query → authenticated query by filters (uses oauth2_scheme)

**Tip:** Open the interactive docs at https://threatscope-i0tj.onrender.com/docs to see the current OpenAPI and try requests.

**Task**

**A) Improve the OpenAPI generated by FastAPI**

Update the route comments in app/api.py so Swagger (/docs) is truly helpful:
* Add tags, summary, description to every endpoint.
* Set response_model explicitly for all routes.
* Document success & error responses with examples:
  * GET /threats/{threat_id}: 200 & 404 examples.
  * POST /threats/query: 200 & 401 examples (auth required), and 422 for validation.

**B) Write concise developer-facing Markdown docs**

In `docs/api.md`, document at least two endpoints, including one authenticated.
Keep it brief and scannable (developers’ style).

**C) Open a PR**

Branch name suggestion: api-docs-openapi
PR description: what you documented and why (1–3 sentences).


## 🎨 Exercise 4 — Creative Enhancement (Innovation Test)

**Duration: ~10 minutes**

**Context**

So far, the exercises focused on clarity, consistency, and documentation. This exercise is about creativity and innovation. 
Sometimes product content needs to go beyond the basics and make the experience more memorable or engaging while staying on-brand.

**Task**

Propose one creative content improvement to ThreatScope. Examples could be:
* A more engaging empty state.
* A playful but professional way to show risk levels.
* A short tagline for the homepage.
* A more compelling call-to-action.

Write the proposed copy (1–2 sentences).
Explain briefly (2–3 sentences) why it works and how it fits a professional cybersecurity brand.

**Deliverable**

A short text proposal, added to the repo as creative.md in the root folder.
Commit and push your branch (e.g., creative-enhancement) and open a PR.

## 📊 Exercise 5 — Data-Driven Thinking

**Duration: ~10–15 minutes**

**Context**

Product content is never “done” — it should be evaluated and improved based on data. 
As a content designer, you need to connect copy choices to metrics that show user or business impact.

**Task**

Suggest 2–3 metrics you would track to measure whether your content changes in ThreatScope are effective.

Examples: completion rate of “industry + country” selection, clicks on CTAs, bounce rate on documentation, API misuse/errors.

For each metric, briefly explain:
* What exactly you’d measure (the metric).
* What success looks like (expected direction).
* How it connects back to content (why it matters).

**Deliverable**

A short Markdown file (metrics.md) with your list of metrics and reasoning.

Commit on a new branch (e.g., metrics-approach) and open a PR.
